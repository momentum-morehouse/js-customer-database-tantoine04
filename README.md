# Make a customer database

## Directions

In this homework, you will build a customer database using DOM manipulation with JavaScript. You will get the customer data via `customers.js`, an included JavaScript module (more info on modules [here](https://medium.com/@mattlag/es6-modules-getting-started-gotchas-2ad154f38e2e)), and format dates via a third-party library, [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/). You can also use other third-party libraries if you wish. 

The customers were generated using [RandomUser.me](https://randomuser.me/), and so they contain a lot of data. For our purposes, you will need their name, address, phone numbers, thumbnail, birthdate, and the date they became a customer, which is stored as `registered` in the data.

*When you create your repl, make sure you select HTML, CSS, JSS as the language. The upper right panel should look like the attached replit image. The "configure the run button" box should be empty.

### Step 1
Render all the data and the image for one customer only. Use HTML to create the empty layout, and then use JavaScript to populate it with specific user data. For example, you should not have any people's names written in your HTML. You should use JavaScript to add the name of a user to the page. Do not include dates in this step. They get their own step.
 
### Step 2
Use [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) to render the joining date for your first customer.

### Step 3 
Once you have rendered one customer, apply the code and render each customer and their data.

## Layout

Your site should look like the following screenshot. You can be creative with design. This is a suggestion. You need to display all the data and the images, but you may take creative license with the design.
